# hospitalproject

In the hospital project I developed, it helps the individual coming to the hospital to easily find the path they want to take and manage their time. The user enters the application without needing to log in (considering the elderly as well), first selecting the place they want to go. If the destination is a polyclinic, they will first choose which polyclinic they want to go to, then select the doctor's name, and the system will show them the path they need to take. Afterwards, it will also show the user the estimated time to reach the destination.
